Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client wanted to develop their game Draw It or Lose it on various platforms as a web-based game. To communicate software and hardware requirements a software design document was requested. The application is developed with games and teams that have unique names with multiple players on each team. Unique names were asked to be implemented so that a user could see if a name was in use already. The client also requested that only a single instance of the game be run in the memory. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did well explaining design constraints, the UML diagram, and requirements regarding software aspects. I was able to convey the design constraints in the documentation with focus on budget and time constraints. In the UML diagram I detailed instances of OOP in the design structure from inheritance to encapsulation. I also provided enough information about each operating platforms server side, client side, development requirements. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The UML diagram gave me a detailed understanding of how the application would be structured. Through the UML diagram I was able to see which classes inherited from each other and areas where data would need to be set private or public. Setting a single instance for the game as mentioned in the design requirements helped me code for the client’s needs. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the development tool part of the evaluation plan. I do not feel like I provided enough detail in that area about development tools for each platform. If I were to revisit the section, I would do more research on each platform to communicate how the development tools worked and how they can improve the application. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The believe users needs were implemented through the design requirements. The game design functionality is clear and concise for users to understand. User’s needs are important to develop the best experience possible when playing using the application. If a user is not happy with an application, they could seek other options. Keeping users satisfied will generate positive feedback and popularity for the application. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approach designing software with user experience in mind and focus of coding standards. When designing software, I also focus on secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities from hackers. In the future I will incorporate a UML diagram when structuring an application. As I have mentioned the UML diagram during the course provided me with great insight on how the application need to be coded.
